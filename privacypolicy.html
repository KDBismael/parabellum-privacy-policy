                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Access.</span> You are entitled to ask us if we are processing your personal data and, if so, for a copy of the personal data we hold about you, as well as obtain certain other information about our processing activities.

                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Erasure.</span> This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Object.</span> Where our reason for processing your personal data is legitimate interest you may object to processing as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Restriction.</span> You may ask us to suspend our use of your personal data in the following scenarios: if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; where our use of your personal data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; where you need us to hold your data for a longer period than we usually would, because you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Transfer.</span> Where it is possible, we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to personal data provided by you which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Withdraw consent.</span> Where our reason for processing is based on your consent, you may withdraw that consent at any time. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Automated decision making.</span> You have the right not to be subject to automated decision making (e.g. ,profiling) that significantly affects you. The exercise of this right is not available to you in the following cases:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <br><br>

                    However, in the first two cases set out above, you still have the right to obtain human intervention in respect of the decision, to express your point of view and to contest the decision.
                    <br><br>
                    There may be legal or other reasons why we cannot, or are not obliged to, fulfill a request to exercise your rights. We will use available lawful exemptions to your individual rights to the extent appropriate. If we decline your request, we will tell you why, subject to legal restrictions.
                    <br><br>
                    You will not have to pay a fee to exercise any of your rights relating to your personal data. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
